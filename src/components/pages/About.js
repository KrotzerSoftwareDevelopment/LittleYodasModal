        I work from home as a Software Engineer, but my dogs are equally my passion. <br />

        my Cairns are both of my kids life, they wake up to them and they go to sleep in my kids beds.
        <br />
        I am a small dog breeder having about 2 to 4 litters a year. 
        Feeding only the best foods and providing plenty of exercise.
        <br />
        Striving to provide premium quality puppies.
